In the software world, we have a ritual called "Hello World." It is the first line of code you write to prove the system works.

But after decades of building complex systems, I realized that "making it work" is only the beginning. The real challenge, and the real beauty, lies in the **craft**.

### The Canvas
My engineering journey has been a long arc across continents and across the entire software stack.

I have spent years deep in the trenches of **Multimedia, Streaming, Networking, Operating System and Embedded Systems**. These are my roots; it is where I learned how to make electrons dance on silicon. Today, I am applying that hard-won wisdom to a new frontier: **Edge AI and NPUs**.

For me, these aren't just isolated domains like **IoT** or **Devices** —they are the tools we use to paint modern life.

### The Journey (Ups and Downs)
I have also navigated the corporate ladder in ways most people don't expect. I spent years in Management Roles, leading teams and driving strategy, before making a deliberate choice to return to the code as a Senior Engineer.

I have seen the industry from both sides: the high-level strategy and the low-level implementation. I’ve learned that titles are temporary, but the **impact** you create is permanent.

### Why I Am Writing
I am building `tribhuwan.dev` as a **digital garden** to share:

1.  **The Hard Tech:** Deep dives into Multimedia, Systems Architecture and my current work in Edge AI and further.
2.  **The Career Map:** The unvarnished truth about navigating an engineering career. I want to share the struggles I faced—starting from a humble background to navigating complex role transitions—so the next generation can walk that path with more confidence.
3.  **The Philosophy:** How to think like an architect and lead with empathy.

### To the Next Generation
If you are just starting out or if you are stuck in the messy middle of your career: **I am writing this for you.**

Technology is not just about conquest; it is an art form. Let’s build something lasting.
